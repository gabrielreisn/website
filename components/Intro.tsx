        This website is a digital garden heavily inspired <i>(grasp copied)</i> by{' '}
        <a href="https://joelhooks.com/">Joel Hooks</a> and a friend, who introduced me to the concept. It's a place
        where things grow, mistakes are made and knowledge is shared like in "Learn in public". Everyone in the
        open-source community and Twitter has been kind to me and helped me for far, so if you want to talk with me for
        any reason feel free to schedule <a href="https://calendly.com/gabrielreisnf/30min">some time with me</a>
      </p>
    </div>
